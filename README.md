# Dotfiles

Gunnar's OS X & Linux (Ubuntu) dotfiles.

## About this project

As with all the other similar repositories found on GitHub, this is my repository with common settings shared betwen Macs and Linux machines I use (currently only Ubuntu). It contains common settings, shell environments and utilities that easy my life on terminals.

There is one command called [dotfiles][dotfiles], and this is my "dotfiles" Git repo.

[dotfiles]: bin/dotfiles

## How the "dotfiles" command works

When [dotfiles][dotfiles] is run for the first time, it does a few things:

1. In Ubuntu, Git is installed if necessary via APT (it's already there in OSX).
1. This repo is cloned into your user directory, under `~/.dotfiles`.
1. Files in `/copy` are copied into `~/`. ([read more](#the-copy-step))
1. Files in `/link` are symlinked into `~/`. ([read more](#the-link-step))
1. You are prompted to choose scripts in `/init` to be executed. The installer attempts to only select relevant scripts, based on the detected OS and the script filename.
1. Your chosen which init scripts are executed (in alphanumeric order, hence the funky names). ([read more](#the-init-step))

On subsequent runs, step 1 is skipped, step 2 just updates the already-existing repo, and step 5 remembers what you selected the last time. The other steps are the same.

### Other subdirectories

* The `/backups` directory gets created when necessary. Any files in `~/` that would have been overwritten by files in `/copy` or `/link` get backed up there.
* The `/bin` directory contains executable shell scripts (including the [dotfiles][dotfiles] script) and symlinks to executable shell scripts. This directory is added to the path.
* The `/caches` directory contains cached files, used by some scripts or functions.
* The `/conf` directory just exists. If a config file doesn't **need** to go in `~/`, reference it from the `/conf` directory.
* The `/bash` directory contains files that are sourced whenever a new bash shell is opened (in alphanumeric order, hence the funky names).
* The `/test` directory contains unit tests for especially complicated bash functions.
* The `/vendor` directory contains third-party libraries.

### The "copy" step
Any file in the `/copy` subdirectory will be copied into `~/`. Any file that _needs_ to be modified with personal information (like [copy/.gitconfig](copy/.gitconfig) which contains an email address and private key) should be _copied_ into `~/`. Because the file you'll be editing is no longer in `~/.dotfiles`, it's less likely to be accidentally committed into your public dotfiles repo.

### The "link" step
Any file in the `/link` subdirectory gets symlinked into `~/` with `ln -s`. Edit one or the other, and you change the file in both places. Don't link files containing sensitive data, or you might accidentally commit that data! If you're linking a directory that might contain sensitive data (like `~/.ssh`) add the sensitive files to your [.gitignore](.gitignore) file!

### The "init" step
Scripts in the `/init` subdirectory will be executed. A whole bunch of things will be installed, but _only_ if they aren't already.

#### OS X

* Minor XCode init via the [init/10_osx_xcode.sh](init/10_osx_xcode.sh) script
* Homebrew via the [init/20_osx_homebrew.sh](init/20_osx_homebrew.sh) script
* Homebrew recipes via the [init/30_osx_homebrew_recipes.sh](init/30_osx_homebrew_recipes.sh) script
* Homebrew casks via the [init/30_osx_homebrew_casks.sh](init/30_osx_homebrew_casks.sh) script

#### Ubuntu
* APT packages and git-extras via the [init/20_ubuntu_apt.sh](init/20_ubuntu_apt.sh) script

#### Both
* Vim plugins via the [init/50_vim.sh](init/50_vim.sh) script

## Installation

### OS X Notes

You need to have [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?=xcode) or, at the very minimum, the [XCode Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?=command%20line%20tools), which are available as a much smaller download.

The easiest way to install the XCode Command Line Tools in OSX 10.9+ is to open up a terminal, type `xcode-select --install` and [follow the prompts](http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/).

_Tested in OSX 10.15_

### Ubuntu Notes

You might want to set up your ubuntu server [like I do it](ansible/roles/ubuntu.yml), but then again, you might not.

Either way, you should at least update/upgrade APT with `sudo apt-get -qq update && sudo apt-get -qq dist-upgrade` first.

_Tested in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS_

### Heed this critically important warning before you install

**If you're not me, please _do not_ install dotfiles directly from this repo!**

Why? Because I often completely break this repo while updating. Which means that if I do that and you run the `dotfiles` command, your home directory will burst into flames, and you'll have to go buy a new computer. No, not really, but it will be very messy.

### Actual installation (for you)

1. [Read my gently-worded note](#heed-this-critically-important-warning-before-you-install)
1. Fork this repo
1. Open a terminal/shell and do this:

```sh
export github_user=YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME

bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/$github_user/dotfiles/main/bin/dotfiles)" && source ~/.bashrc
```

Since you'll be using the [dotfiles][dotfiles] command on subsequent runs, you'll only have to export the `github_user` variable for the initial install.

There's a lot of stuff that requires admin access via `sudo`, so be warned that you might need to enter your password here or there.

### Actual installation (for me)

```sh
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guw/dotfiles/main/bin/dotfiles)"
```

## Aliases and Functions
To keep things easy, the `~/.bashrc` and `~/.profile` files are extremely simple, and should never need to be modified. Instead, add your aliases, functions, settings, etc into one of the files in the `bash` subdirectory, or add a new file. They're all automatically sourced when a new shell is opened. Take a look, I have [a lot of aliases and functions](bash). My [fancy prompt](bash/50_prompt.sh) is based on Liquibase which shows things like git/svn repo and Mac battery/load status.

## Private Exports
Should you ever want to create private exports, the `~/.profile` file is intentionally not linked but copied. Feel free to add any sensitive export to that file.

## Scripts
In addition to the aforementioned [dotfiles][dotfiles] script, there are a few other [bin scripts](bin).

* [dotfiles][dotfiles] - (re)initialize dotfiles. It might ask for your password (for `sudo`).
* [src](link/.bashrc#L8-18) - (re)source all files in `/bash` directory
* Look through the [bin](bin) subdirectory for a few more.
